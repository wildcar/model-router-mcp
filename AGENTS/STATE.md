# State

Current snapshot. Overwrite each iteration.

## Goal

Build an MCP server (Streamable HTTP) that routes requests to AI models across
providers and modalities, with a model registry, per-external-user request/response
logging, and per-request cost accounting, plus a web test+admin console — and run
it as a managed service on this host.

## Now

- ✅ Phases 0–3 + deploy wrapper (deployed and running on the host).
- ✅ Phase 4: CLI engines — `codex` (`codex exec --json`, ported event parsing)
  and `claude` (`claude -p --output-format json`), via the `run_cli` MCP tool and
  `/api/cli`. Shared subprocess helper (`adapters/_subprocess.py`) with exec
  resolution (PATH + nvm/.local fallbacks) and a cwd whitelist
  (`CLI_ALLOWED_CWD_ROOTS`). Claude CLI's `total_cost_usd` is used as a cost
  override. Test console gained a `cli` modality + engine selector.
- ✅ Verified live: `claude` run_cli end-to-end (text + usage + provider cost +
  session_id). Both CLI providers enabled (binaries on PATH).
- ✅ Tests green: `pytest` (28 passed).

## Next

- Phase 5: registry admin polish; subscription/amortization UI; tune seed prices.
- Phase 6: hardening, optional streaming for long CLI/chat runs.
- Prod note: the `modelrouter` user needs `codex`/`claude` on its PATH and their
  auth to use CLI engines (codex auth.json is synced; claude needs its own login
  or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the service env).

## Open questions

- Codex `auth.json` for the `modelrouter` user (dedicated copy vs reuse keeper's
  via `openai-auth-sync`) — decide when CLI/Codex adapters land.
- Subdomain + TLS cert name for nginx (placeholder `router.example.com`).
- Real end-to-end chat still needs a live `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (chain proven via
  stub tests).

## Deferred

- Automated update triggers (git-poll timer / inotify `.path` / webhook) — for now
  updates are the manual `deploy.sh`.
- Streaming MCP responses (CLI/long chat); full billing/amortization rollups;
  multi-connection concurrency.
